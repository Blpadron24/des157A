                   <p> Overlays can be a great tool for designers to use, especially when trying to get a user to perform an action. Overlays can also be easily overused or implemented incorrectly. If an overlay requires a user to scroll too much it can become combersome and result in the user giving up before finishing whatever the overlay is trying to get them to do.
                It is also possible for overlays to provide the user with a glitchy experience especially if the designer is not thinking about the user experience. This happens often because overlays are typically designed for the designer instead of the user. With that being said overlays should be used for easy to do tasks. They should'nt mess with the usability of a website or interrupt the flow of the site. They should be used to enhance the user experience not take away from it.

                   <p>This article explains how important it is to design for the user experience. By considering their audience's needs and potentional biases, designers are able to create designs that effective. This applies to everything a designer creates, including delivery media that some people take for granted like forms. To create a form is designed with the user experience in mind, a designer should make it as easy to get through as possible. This includes starting with easy questions, using proximity and grouping to give the form a nice flow, and proving users with feedback. The form linked below is a good example of this because it clearly defines everything the user needs to input and provies feedback while creating a password.

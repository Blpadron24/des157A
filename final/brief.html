                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                    <p> 
                        For this project I want to continue to work on my Game On Project. I want to add some features that make it feel more complete and give the user different variations of the game. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        My goals for this project are to add a randomizer which chooses an image when the page is reloaded to change the plushie the players are playing for. That way the players are encouraged to play again for a different prize.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                    <p>The game is going to look the same, I may have an overlay open with the game rules so the players read them before moving on to play. I want to have the image displayed randomly when the page is loaded.</p>

                    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                    <p>I hope to have some sort of indicator that is shown when the players hover over a clickable element. I also want to have something show whoâ€™s turn it is other than the text. Maybe changing the opacity the button divs to show the color more clearly will add the look of it being that players turn.</p>

                    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                    <p>I want to make sure the players of my game know how to interact with it easily. I want to give them enough feedback that makes them feel like they are interacting with the elements available. I also want them to want to play the game again which I think I can achieve by adding multiple prize options. </p>

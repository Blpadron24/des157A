                    <h2>Player Cue's</h2>
                    <p> 
                       As I observed my testers interact with my project I noticed it wasn't apparent to them what player was taking their turn. To fix this they suggested to add some sort of cue that makes it easy to idenify the active player. My plan is to make the active players buttons "light up" and blink when its their turn. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Prizes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Although my testers really like my illustrations they did express that the "prize" did not connect with the game because the when a player wins I don't have anything to show what they won exactly. To fix this i plan on having an overlay that appears with the plush that they won. I also want to add some animations to the plush.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Feedback</h2>
                    <p>Although the game does gove feedback when the buttons are clicked I was recommended to add audio to when the game swiches players due to a bad roll. I will be adding audio to increase the feedback the game provides players. </p>
